## A multiplayer counting game

Two players compete against each other to click the cards in the correct order (1-10) and see who can get the fastest time. Players have to be careful not to click out of order or on the wrong tile or else the remaining cards will reshuffle.

#### How to Play:
Use the mouse to select the correct card on the randomized grid. Go as fast as possible without making mistakes.
